Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table. The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section. My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing. We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked. Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy. Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.\n",

Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal. So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night. The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh. I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat. The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was. This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED! The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist. For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.\n",

I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat ! I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable. After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods. Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo. The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had! Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.\n",

I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious. This is one of the better buffets that I have been to. The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal! At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy. Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. Service was fine and the waitress was friendly. The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.

The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best. My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed. We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!

The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside. The food was great as always, compliments to the chef. The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us. When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way. There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat. The place was not clean and the food oh so stale! So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\n",

By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known. Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great. The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none. The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND. I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.

Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's. The descriptions said \"yum yum sauce\" and another said \"eel sauce\", yet another said \"spicy mayo\"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them. Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back. Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too. Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty. I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.

My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean. I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago. We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste. This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed. The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor. I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place. If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.\n",

Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end. I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food. The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc. The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough. The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle. This was my first time and I can't wait until the next. The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.\n",

I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back \"ya'all\". I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list. It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant. The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables). The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland. The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time. Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.\n",
